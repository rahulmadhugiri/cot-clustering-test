What happens if running out of fuel?,"If a diesel engine runs out of fuel, air is pulled into the fuel system. To prime the engine, a substantial amount of fuel needs to be added to the tank, and the ignition switch needs to be pushed twice without the foot on the brake to put the vehicle in RUN position. This will activate the in-tank fuel pump for approximately 30 seconds. The process needs to be repeated twice, and then the engine can be started using the normal starting procedure. The engine may run rough until the air is forced from all the fuel lines. It is important to note that the high-pressure fuel system should not be opened with the engine running, as engine operation causes high fuel pressure, and high-pressure fuel spray can cause serious injury or death.",Not Hallucinated,TRUE,FALSE

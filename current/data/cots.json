    "question": "Will the Hazard Warning Flashers wear down the battery if left on for a long time?",
    "answer": "Yes with extended use the Hazard Warning Flashers can drain the car battery.",
    "cot": "The car battery supplies power to all electrical systems in the car, including the Hazard Warning Flashers. These flashers, when left on for a prolonged period, continue to consume power. This continued use can potentially drain the battery, especially if the car is not running to replenish the battery's charge."

    "question": "What should I pay attention to when the engine is cold?",
    "answer": "When the engine is cold you should avoid full-throttle starts and rapid acceleration.",
    "cot": "Cold engines require some time to warm up as the oil may not have fully circulated throughout the engine. Rapid acceleration or full-throttle starts could potentially damage the engine components. Therefore, you should avoid these actions when the engine is cold."

    "question": "What should I pay attention to when the engine is cold?",
    "answer": "When the engine is cold you should avoid full-throttle starts and rapid acceleration.",
    "cot": "Starting the engine cold can cause the gasoline to not combust as efficiently as it should. This insufficient combustion can lead to rapid acceleration and full-throttle starts being more harmful to the engine. Thus, these should be avoided when the engine is cold."

    "question": "What should I pay attention to when the engine is cold?",
    "answer": "When the engine is cold you should avoid full-throttle starts and rapid acceleration.",
    "cot": "When the engine is cold, the metal components haven't expanded to their operating size. This can lead to increased friction if full power is applied suddenly, which can be damaging. Therefore, you should avoid full-throttle starts and rapid acceleration."

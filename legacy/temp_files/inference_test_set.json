    "question": "If the Malfunction Indicator Light is on, can I continue to drive? If so, for how long?",
    "answer": "If the ESC Activation/Malfunction Indicator Light comes on continuously with the engine running, it indicates that a malfunction has been detected in the ESC system. If this light remains on after several ignition cycles, and the vehicle has been driven several miles (kilometers) at speeds greater than 30 mph (48 km/h), it is recommended to see an authorized dealer as soon as possible to have the problem diagnosed and corrected. It is not recommended to continue driving the vehicle with the Malfunction Indicator Light on for an extended period of time as it may affect the vehicle's stability and safety.",

    "answer": "Yes, after remotely starting the car, the temperature in the car can be automatically adjusted by using the Automatic Temperature Control (ATC) Panel. Once the desired temperature is set, the system will achieve and automatically maintain that comfort level. The blower fan will remain on low until the engine warms up, and then it will increase in speed and transition into Auto mode. It is not necessary to move the temperature settings for cold or hot vehicles as the system automatically adjusts the temperature, mode, and blower speed to provide comfort as quickly as possible.",

    "question": "The OBD II system seems not ready.  What might be the possible causes, and what should I do?",
    "answer": "Possible causes for the OBD II system not being ready include recent vehicle servicing, a depleted battery, or a battery replacement. If your OBD II system is not ready, you should not proceed to the I/M station. Instead, you should see an authorized dealer or repair facility. If your vehicle was recently serviced or had a battery failure or replacement, you may need to do nothing more than drive your vehicle as you normally would in order for your OBD II system to update. A recheck with the previously mentioned test routine may then indicate that the system is now ready. To check if your OBD II system is ready, cycle the ignition switch to the ON position, but do not crank or start the engine. As soon as you cycle the ignition switch to the ON position, you will see the Malfunction Indicator Light (MIL) symbol come on as part of a normal bulb check. Approximately 15 seconds later, one of two things will happen: The MIL will flash for about 10 seconds and then return to being fully illuminated until you turn OFF the ignition or start the engine. This means that your vehicle's OBD II system is not ready and you should not proceed to the I/M station. The MIL will not flash at all and will remain fully",
